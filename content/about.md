Hi I'm Tom, you can find out a little about me...

I code professionally for Intilery (Java, JavaScript, AWS, Python), and for fun with sounds or with my son (Supercollider, Clojure; Unity, C#).

I'm learning to play piano, and like to mix this up with some Maschine 3 beats.

I keep fit with kick boxking and tai-chi, and when I can I'll be out sailing at Budworth SC.

As well as looking after my kids, I live with 2 cats and my wife; the smallest cat, Cleo is pictured snoozing below:
